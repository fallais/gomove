# gomove

GoMove is a CLI application that prevents your computer session from locking by periodically moving the mouse cursor slightly. It's designed to work on both Windows and Linux systems (but now Windows only).

## Why ?

You may not want your session being lock because :

- You have a long command running on terminal
- You want it
